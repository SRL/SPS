SPS - SRL Positioning System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPS is a 100% colour positioning system used to find a player's location in Runescape. 
This allows for reflection-like colour walking.  Everything you need to know about SPS 
can be found at SRL-Forums.  SPS was originally developed by marpis and has since been 
developed by the SRL community.
